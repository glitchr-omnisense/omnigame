# Symfony

There is no Omnigame bundle, and omnibridge/symfony has no Omnigame wiring yet: a Symfony
application declares the registry as a service of its own. Every factory takes the HTTP client as
its one constructor argument (`?Symfony\Contracts\HttpClient\HttpClientInterface`), which
autowiring fills with the application's `http_client` service.

## The registry as a service

```yaml
# config/services.yaml
services:
    _defaults:
        autowire: true

    Omnigame\Steam\SteamFactory: ~
    Omnigame\Gog\GogFactory: ~
    Omnigame\Igdb\IgdbFactory: ~

    Omnigame\Registry:
        arguments:
            $factories:
                - '@Omnigame\Steam\SteamFactory'
                - '@Omnigame\Gog\GogFactory'
                - '@Omnigame\Igdb\IgdbFactory'
            $config:
                steam:
                    factory: steam
                    options:
                        key: '%env(default::STEAM_WEB_API_KEY)%'   # only for players' libraries
                        language: fr
                        country: FR
                gog:
                    factory: gog
                    options: { locale: fr-FR, country: FR, currency: EUR }
                igdb:
                    factory: igdb
                    options:
                        client_id: '%env(TWITCH_CLIENT_ID)%'
                        client_secret: '%env(TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET)%'
```

```sh
# .env.local, or bin/console secrets:set
STEAM_WEB_API_KEY=...
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=...
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

The order of `$config` is the order `Registry::game()` asks the providers in when no name is given.
Steam's `key` is optional: empty, the provider reads the store and refuses players' libraries (an
empty option is the same as none).

A tag gathers the factories instead of listing them:

```yaml
services:
    _instanceof:
        Omnigame\ProviderFactoryInterface:
            tags: ['omnigame.factory']

    Omnigame\Registry:
        arguments:
            $factories: !tagged_iterator omnigame.factory
            $config: '%omnigame.providers%'
```

## Using it

```php
use Omnigame\Model\GameRef;
use Omnigame\Registry;
use Symfony\Contracts\Cache\CacheInterface;
use Symfony\Contracts\Cache\ItemInterface;

final class StorePanel
{
    public function __construct(private readonly Registry $stores, private readonly CacheInterface $cache)
    {
    }

    /** @return ?array<string, mixed> */
    public function steam(int $app): ?array
    {
        return $this->cache->get('steam.'.$app.'.fr', function (ItemInterface $item) use ($app): ?array {
            $item->expiresAfter(6 * 3600);        // prices change with sales

            return $this->stores->catalogue('steam')->game(GameRef::steam($app), 'fr', 'FR')?->toArray();
        });
    }
}
```

Nothing is built when the container compiles: a provider is built, and its required options
checked, the first time the registry is asked for it, then kept. Records are not cached by
Omnigame: the stores' endpoints are not made for heavy traffic (Steam's and GOG's storefront
endpoints are undocumented), and the application's cache keeps them.

There is no command, event, Twig function or route. Show each provider's
`capabilities()->attribution` beside its records, as its terms ask: `Game::$source` names the
provider a record came from.

This page was written from the classes' constructors; it was not run in a Symfony kernel.
